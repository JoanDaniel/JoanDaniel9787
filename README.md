  The gesture-based door control system based on gesture recognition sensors that allows controlling doors in public spaces without touching any surface. We have provided the system concept and two sets of gestures that can be used to control the door. The results show that the system is intuitive to use and that the subjects would strongly prefer this system to touching door handles in public toilets, indicating that this system is a viable alternative to current solutions. However, our system signifies only a first step in this direction and there are numerous improvements that can be applied to future iterations. In the future, we plan on switching to a system providing this functionality, or integrate additional sensors that measure the state. It is particularly interesting to display whether a door is closed or open. We are considering using a LCD display that could provide an iconic representation of the system state if an error has occurred or if the hand is obstructing the gesture area. This feedback should ideally be available on both sides of the door.They are more sensitive.
